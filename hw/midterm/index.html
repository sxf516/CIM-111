        <h2>COOGEE</h2>
        <section id="grid4">
            <p>Coogee Pavilion is a large and happening place, located right off Coogee Beach, south of Bondi. Not only does it have a rooftop with four different bars and a huge wrap-around balcony, but also a great downstairs restaurant. While the downstairs of 'the Pav' is a very family friendly venue, complete with giant magnetic scrabble, ping pong and an in-house theatrette, the upstairs rooftop is an adults only zone. And from the spectacular Coogee Pavilion rooftop bar in Sydney you get a magical view of the Australian coastline and the nearby surroundings. One of the best coastal views from a rooftop bar in all of Australia, according to many.</p>

            <p>The rooftop terrace comes with a very modern, lush and ocean-vibe setting with bright colors and lots of different places to settle down. Here you can enjoy great food inspired by the Eastern Mediterranean, a large selection of beer and wines along with excotic and fresh cocktails. A great place for relaxing ocean side drinks and bites anytime of the day.</p>
